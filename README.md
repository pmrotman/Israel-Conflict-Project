# Israel-Conflict-Project
Description:
R-shiny app that allows a user to filter data on the Israel-Palestine conflict since 2016. 
Allows the user to view data, plot a map of the data, and visualize the data in a bar chart and perform a PCA on region and event type.
On the Data Selection tab, the user filters the data, selecting a date range, event types, and regions. The user can view several columns of the data and select a plot button.
Once the plot button has been selected, a map with all selected data points is generated in the Map tab. In the PCA tab, a bar plot of counts vs event type and region is produced, and a principal component analysis is performed on the filtered data. The output is a biplot and a summary of the data.

Usage:
To run the app in an R environment, run the command: runGitHub("", "", subdir = "").
